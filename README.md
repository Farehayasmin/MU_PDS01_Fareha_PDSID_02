# Housing Price Prediction Regression Analysis

This project applies regression analysis techniques to predict housing prices using the California Housing Dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We use the **California Housing Dataset** from Scikit-Learn, which includes features like average income, house age, and population density to predict housing prices.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Load and examine dataset statistics and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scale features for optimal model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model to predict house prices.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
5. **Visualization**: Plot actual vs. predicted prices for visual evaluation.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python regression_analysis.py
   ```

## Results
- Model performance metrics (MSE, R²) are printed in the console.
- A scatter plot shows the relationship between actual and predicted prices.
